# Phising_detection

As each coin has two sides, so does technology. On one hand, with the advancement in technology the lives are getting better, on the other hand, the ill use of technology is also increasing. The suspicious activities are increasing ranging from dos attacks, phishing, hacking etc. In this hackathon, we are concerned with the increasing phishing attacks.


Typically, Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware.
